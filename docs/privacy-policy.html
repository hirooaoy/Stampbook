        <div class="intro">
            <p><strong>Welcome to Stampbook!</strong></p>
            <p>We believe in being transparent about how we collect and use your data. This privacy policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <li><strong>Username and display name</strong> - Chosen by you or generated automatically</li>
            <li><strong>Email address</strong> - Only if you choose to share it through Apple Sign In (optional - Apple gives you the choice to share or hide your email)</li>

            <li><strong>Bio</strong> - Optional text description</li>
            <li><strong>Display name</strong> - Your chosen name shown to other users</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Photos and Camera</h3>
        <p>With your permission, we access:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera</strong> - To take photos at stamp locations for your personal memories</li>
            <li><strong>Photo Library</strong> - To add existing photos from your library to your stamp collection</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Important: Photos you add are stored privately in your collection and are only shared if you explicitly post them to your feed. We only request camera/photo access when you choose to add a photo.</em></p>
        
        <h3>Location Data</h3>
        <p>We collect your precise location when you're actively using the app to:</p>

            <li><strong>Enable stamp collection</strong> when you're within 150 meters of a stamp location</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Important: We only request "While Using the App" location permission. We do NOT track your location in the background or when the app is closed. Your location is only used in real-time to show your position on the map and determine if you're close enough (within 150 meters) to collect a stamp. Location data is not stored permanently.</em></p>
        
        <h3>Content You Create</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Collected stamps</strong> - Record of which stamps you've collected and which curated collections you're viewing (you cannot create custom collections, only collect from pre-made collections we provide)</li>
            <li><strong>Comments</strong> - Comments you post on stamps</li>
            <li><strong>Likes</strong> - Stamps you've liked</li>
            <li><strong>Posts</strong> - Stamps you share to your feed with optional captions</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Social Interactions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Follows</strong> - Users you follow and users who follow you</li>
            <li><strong>Feed activity</strong> - Your interactions with other users' posts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Notifications</h3>
        <p>We send in-app notifications to keep you updated on social activity:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Comment notifications</strong> - When someone comments on your post</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Important: These are in-app notifications only (shown in the notification bell within the app). We do NOT currently send push notifications to your device. All notification data is stored in our database and only visible to you.</em></p>
        
        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        </ul>
        
        <p>We do not share your data with any other third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        
        <h3>Access Your Data</h3>
        <p>You can view and download your profile information, collected stamps, and posts directly in the app.</p>
        
        <h3>Edit Your Data</h3>
        <p>You can edit your profile information (username, display name, bio, profile picture) at any time in the Profile settings.</p>
        
        <h3>Delete Your Content</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Delete individual posts from your feed</li>
            <li>Delete comments you've written</li>
            <li>Unlike stamps</li>
            <li>Unfollow users</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Delete Your Account</h3>
        <p>You can request account deletion through the app (Profile → Settings → Delete Account) or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:watagumo.studio@gmail.com">watagumo.studio@gmail.com</a>. We will manually delete your account within 3 business days. When your account is deleted:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your profile will be permanently deleted</li>
            <li>Your collected stamps will be removed</li>
            <li>Your posts and comments will be deleted</li>
            <li>This action cannot be undone</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Note: At our current small scale (MVP stage), account deletion is handled manually to ensure complete and proper removal of all your data.</em></p>
        
        <h3>Location Permissions</h3>
        <p>You can control location permissions at any time through your device settings (Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services → Stampbook). The app requires location access to function properly (collecting stamps requires knowing your location).</p>
        
        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        
        <p>We retain your data as long as your account is active. If you request account deletion, we will manually delete your data within 3 business days, except:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data we're required to keep for legal compliance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>Stampbook is not intended for children under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.</p>
        
        <h2>8. International Users</h2>
        
        <p>Stampbook is operated from the United States. If you're using the app from outside the U.S., your data will be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States and other countries where Firebase operates. By using Stampbook, you consent to this transfer.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We'll notify you of significant changes by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Updating the "Last updated" date at the top</li>
            <li>Posting a notice in the app</li>
            <li>Emailing you (if we have your email)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Your continued use of Stampbook after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
        
        <h2>10. Security</h2>
        
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Secure authentication through Apple Sign In</li>
            <li>Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)</li>
            <li>Secure cloud storage with Firebase</li>
            <li>Regular security reviews</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
        
        <h2>11. California Privacy Rights (CCPA)</h2>
        
        <p>If you're a California resident, you have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Know</strong> what personal information we collect and how we use it</li>
            <li><strong>Delete</strong> your personal information (with some exceptions)</li>
            <li><strong>Opt-out</strong> of the sale of your personal information (we don't sell your data)</li>
            <li><strong>Non-discrimination</strong> for exercising your rights</li>
